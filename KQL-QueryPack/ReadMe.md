# Invictus: Cloud Incident Response Query Pack
The cloud incident response query pack is part of our [HANDS-ON INCIDENT RESPONSE IN THE CLOUD](https://www.invictus-ir.com/training) training. The query pack is used in this training but is also free to use by everyone because we like to deliver open-source cloud incident response tools to the community. Queries from the following tables are included:

All queries are focussed on performing incident response on Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365 data incidents.
